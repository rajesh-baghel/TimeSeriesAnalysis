## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze the trend and patterns in the total purchase amount over time. By applying time series analysis techniques, we aim to uncover any underlying trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data. This analysis can provide valuable insights for business decision-making and forecasting future purchase amounts.

## Installation

To run the code in this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Place the data file (`your_data_file.csv`) in the same directory as the project files.
3. Update the `your_data_file.csv` filename in the code to match your actual data file.
4. Run the code to perform the time series analysis and generate insights.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in the file `your_data_file.csv`. It contains information about the total purchase amount over time, including the date, product details, quantity, unit price, customer ID, country, segment, and other relevant variables.

## Analysis Steps

1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Perform data exploration and visualization to understand the data.
3. Check for stationarity using statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test.
4. Apply appropriate techniques like differencing or decomposition to make the data stationary.
5. Conduct trend analysis using methods like moving averages, exponential smoothing, or trend decomposition.
6. Perform residual analysis to check for any remaining patterns or autocorrelation in the data.
7. Select an appropriate time series model based on the analysis and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
8. Forecast future purchase amounts using the selected model and assess the accuracy and uncertainty of the forecasts.

## Results and Insights

The time series analysis of the total purchase amount reveals the following insights and trends:

- The descriptive statistics show the overall distribution of the total purchase amount, including the mean, standard deviation, and minimum/maximum values.
- Monthly trends highlight the variations in total purchase amounts over different months.
- Decomposition analysis separates the data into trend, seasonal, and residual components, providing insights into the long-term trend, seasonal patterns, and random fluctuations.
- The trend component shows the overall upward or downward movement in the total purchase amount over time.
- The seasonal component captures the recurring patterns or seasonality in the data.
- The residual component represents the random variation that cannot be explained by the trend or seasonality.

These insights can help in understanding the underlying patterns and trends in the total purchase amount, identifying seasonality effects, and making informed business decisions.
